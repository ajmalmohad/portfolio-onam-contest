            <h1>History</h1>
            <div class="history">
                <p class="time">
                    There once was an Asura king named Mahabali, who ruled over the people
                    of what is now Kerala. Mahabali was a generous and benevolent ruler, beloved by his people
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    He was, in fact, the descendant of Prahlad, whose devotion to Lord Vishnu saved his life
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    But Mahabali‚Äôs success on Earth made the Gods jealous, and they conspired to defeat him.
                    Ironically, Lord Vishnu was asked to help the Gods achieve their wish
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    So Vishnu came to Mahabali disguised as a poor Brahmin dwarf named Vamana
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    Since word was that Mahabali was a very generous king, Vamana asked him for
                    a piece of land that measured three of his steps
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    Mahabali agreed, but as soon as he did, Vamana began to grow.¬† He continued 
                    to grow until he reached cosmic proportions ‚Äì and then, he took his steps
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    His first step covered all the land, his second covered the sky. Seeing that 
                    Vamana had no place for his third step, Mahabali willingly offered his head
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    When Vishnu stepped on Mahabali‚Äôs head, he was sent into the underworld, and 
                    the wish of the Gods was granted
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    However, since Mahabali was so beloved by his people, Vishnu granted him the ability
                    to come back to the surface of the Earth once a year, to see his people
                </p>
                <p class="time">
                    This annual return of Mahabali is celebrated in Kerala as the festival of Onam
